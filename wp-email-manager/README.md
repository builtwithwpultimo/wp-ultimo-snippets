# WP Email Manager Snippet Library 

You'll find the following snippets in ðŸ“‚ `wp-email-manager` folder.

- Sync domain with email server when added in WP Ultimo - File: `sync-add-domain-with-email-server.php`
- Sync domain with email server when deleted in WP Ultimo - File: `sync-delete-domain-with-email-server.php`

**Prerequisite:**

1) You are using WP Email Manager V 1.0.6.4 + and WP Ultimo V2.0 +.
2) You have enabled WP Ultimo integration in the general settings section.

**Note:** If a particular subsite has the _**Custom Configuration Addon**_ enabled, the domain syncing will be associated with the subsiteâ€™s email server and not the networkâ€™s email server.
